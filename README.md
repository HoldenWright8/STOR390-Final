# STOR390-Final

This repository hosts two files for the STOR 390 Final Project submission. It contains my final paper in both PDF and RMD format.

In their paper, “Consumer-lending discrimination in the FinTech Era” Robert Bartlett, Adair Morse, Richard Stanton, and Nancy Wallace aim to prove that minorities pay significantly higher interest rates on mortgage loans than non-minorities with equivalent credit risk metrics. Looking towards the future in this new era of AI driven analysis, they also investigate whether FinTech platforms reduce or perpetuate lending disparities. This paper critiques their methods and, through the lens of Rawlsian justice, argues that while FinTech algorithms show promise in reducing human bias, they still fall short of achieving true equity by perpetuating systemic disparities through data-driven decision-making.
